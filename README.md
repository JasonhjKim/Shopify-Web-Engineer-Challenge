## Shopify-Web-Engineer Challenge
Build a web app to search for waste items using the Toronto Waste Wizard database, and save frequently used ones.

### Navigation
- index.html
- /js/script.js
- /css/style.css

### Something I would do differently next time
- I would instead create a class next time for better code coupling
- I would make api call onload and save it on to the object above instead of calling every time user enters a new search
